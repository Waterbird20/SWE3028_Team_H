\subsection{Backend}
Django, a Python web framework, was employed for server-side development.
% It handles user authentication, routing and business logic implementation. 
% The backend interacts with the database, utilizing SQLite for data storage and retrieval. External APIs are integrated to fetch relevant information for the exchange program and university details. 
% NLP libraries of KoT5 and GPT-4 are utilized for text summarization and analysis. AWS Lightsail provides the infrastructure for hosting the backend server, ensuring reliable and scalable performance. 
% We chose to use AWS server with 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU, and 40GB SSD, as it offers a lightweight and suitable solution for our initial deployment, despite its limitations.

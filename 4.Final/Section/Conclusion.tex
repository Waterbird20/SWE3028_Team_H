In conclusion, our project has focused on predicting the short-term movements of blue-chip stocks, a strategy that has proven effective over periods ranging from a few days to a few months. 
To achieve this, we have leveraged advanced machine learning techniques, employing models: LSTM, GRU, and Transformer.

Additionally, we integrated VADER, a sentiment analysis tool, to incorporate the impact of recent events and news on stock prices. 
This integration aimed to capture both short- and long-term changes in stock prices influenced by current events. 
While our results have been promising, there is potential for further improvement. 
Enhancing the feature set, particularly for the Transformer model, could yield more accurate predictions. 
Access to historical news articles and professional analysts' reports would also significantly enrich our dataset, potentially leading to more nuanced and informed predictions.

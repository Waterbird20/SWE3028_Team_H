This project aims to predict the stock price of some selected stocks in KODEX 200 and S\&P 500 on a day-by-day basis.
Leveraging data sourced from the Korea Exchange (KRX) and Nasdaq, we will undertake the training and evaluation of a diverse set of machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer. 
We focus on predicting the stock price of the next a few days. 
In a contrast to the general stock price prediction system of many stock firms, we do not analyse the fundamental of the company. 
We focus on the short-term changes of the stock price, and attempts to reflect the recent issues via VADER.

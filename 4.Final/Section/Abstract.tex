This project aims to predict the stock price of SAMSUNG Electronics utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. 
Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model tailored to the stock prices of SAMSUNG Electronics. 
Leveraging data sourced from the Korea Exchange (KRX), we will undertake the training and evaluation of a diverse set of machine learning models, 
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Transformer.
This accessibility contributes significantly to the domains of investment decision-making, lowering the entry barrier for users interested in this field.
Given the computationally intensive nature of our endeavor, our primary focus remains on constructing an accurate predictive model specifically designed for the stock prices of SAMSUNG Electronics. 
SAMSUNG Electronics stands as one of the most popular and actively traded stocks in South Korea, making it an ideal candidate for our predictive model.
Furthermore, as a testament to our commitment to accessibility, our model will be deployed as a publicly accessible web service. 
This ensures that users can harness the power of our predictive model conveniently.

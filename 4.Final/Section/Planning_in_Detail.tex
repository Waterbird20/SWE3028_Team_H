Our project timeline is outlined as follows: 
In the first three weeks, we conducted preliminary studies and research to establish the project's foundation. 
From the fourth to the sixth week, the frontend team will focus on designing the user interface(UI) and user experience(UX), 
while the backend team will collect data and prepare the necessary infrastructure. 
In the subsequent weeks up to the thirteenth week, the frontend team will proceed to develop the web page and set up the AWS server, 
while the backend team will be responsible for implementing the AI model, designing backend APIs, and continually improving the model's performance. 
Finally, in the last three weeks leading up to the presentation, we will rigorously test the AI model and the web application before deploying the web page for the final presentation.

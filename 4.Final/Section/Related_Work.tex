Recent trends in stock price prediction research have focused on deep learning-based regression models. 
LSTM often incorporate advanced validation techniques like walk-forward validation to enhance predictive accuracy \cite{li2019dp}. 
Additionally, novel approaches such as the sentiment-ARMA model have been proposed, combining the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) with sentiment analysis of financial news articles, offering a new perspective in this domain \cite{mehtab2021stock}.
In parallel, there has been exploration into Particle Filter Recurrent Neural Networks (PF-RNNs), a new family of RNNs designed to model internal uncertainty, which are integrated into LSTM-based networks alongside VADER for sentiment analysis and differential privacy mechanisms \cite{ma2020particle}. 
This integration leverages financial news data and sentiment scores to predict stock market movements \cite{li2019dp}\cite{li2022novel}. 

Our work builds upon these advancements, employing VADER to analyze short-term stock price changes and demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models, particularly on stable stocks.
